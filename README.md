# Simulate spatial transcriptomics data 

This package simulates spatial transcriptomics data with spatially varying correlation structure. It uses a real dataset as a "scaffold" from which to simulate realistic expression datasets.

For a tutorial on how to simulate a spatial transcriptomics dataset, please see the Jupyter notebook, `simulate_spatial_data.ipynb`.
